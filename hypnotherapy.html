        <h1>Hypnotherapy</h1>
        <h2>A gentle, non-invasive approach</h2>
        <p>Hypnotherapy is utilized in a calm, non-directive manner. It does not involve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of control</li>
            <li>Uncovering memories</li>
            <li>Forced emotional processing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instead, hypnotherapy supports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Relaxation</li>
            <li>Grounding</li>
            <li>Nervous system settling</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What sessions are like</h1>
        <p>Sessions are quiet and steady, often including simple grounding techniques, gentle guided imagery, and support with settling. Clients are reminded that sessions can pause or stop at any point, with no requirement to disclose personal information.</p>
